/ First a welcome message to get the questionnaire going

W PLEASE TELL ME YOUR NAME
  & {Mstate ASKNAME}
/ And a simple void input response and quitting message
V WELL?
Q BYE!

/ The next keyword set prevents the conversation from continuing after the name and address have already been given and confirmed
<[Mstate]==FINISH>: K [X?]
 R I've got your details now - goodbye!
 R Please could you go now?

/ The next keyword set deals with confirming words
K YES
K CORRECT
K RIGHT
 <[Mstate]==CONFIRMNAME>: R Good. Now please tell me your Oxford address.
                          & {Mstate ASKADDR}
 <[Mstate]==CONFIRMADDR>: R Excellent. That's it, now - goodbye!
                          & {Mstate FINISH}

/ Now for a set of disconfirming words
K NO
K INCORRECT
K WRONG
 <[Mstate]==CONFIRMNAME>: R Let's start again, then. Please give me your first name followed by your surname.
                          & {Mstate ASKNAME}
 <[Mstate]==CONFIRMADDR>: R Let's do that again, then. Please give me your full Oxford address.
                          & {Mstate ASKADDR}

/ The next keyword will respond only to input of exactly two words
K [] [word1] [word2] []
 <[Mstate]==ASKNAME>: R OK - so your first name is [word1] and your surname is [word2]?
                      & {Mstate CONFIRMNAME
                         Mfirstname [word1]
                         Msurname [word2]}

/ The next keyword set identifies an Oxford address plus postcode.
/ It assumes that the address starts with a number.
K [number] [X] [!1?] OXFORD [!2?] OX[dig1][dig2?] [dig3][let1][let2]
K [number] [X] [!1?] OXFORD [!2?] OX[dig1][dig2?][dig3][let1][let2]
 <[Mstate]==ASKADDR>: R Fine. I have your name as [Mfirstname] [Msurname] and your address as [number] [X] OXFORD, OX[dig1][dig2?] [dig3][let1][let2]
                      & {Mstate CONFIRMADDR
                         Maddress [number] [X] , OXFORD
                         Mpostcode OX[dig1][dig2?] [dig3][let1][let2]}

/ The next keyword is designed to identify an Oxford address with no postcode
K [number] [X] [!?] OXFORD
 <[Mstate]==ASKADDR>: R OK - so your Oxford address is [number] [X], but what's your postcode?
                      & {Mstate ASKPOST
                         Maddress [number] [X] , OXFORD}

/ The next keyword is designed to identify an Oxford postcode.
K OX[dig1][dig2?] [dig3][let1][let2]
K OX[dig1][dig2?][dig3][let1][let2]
 <[Mstate]==ASKPOST>: R Fine. I have your name as [Mfirstname] [Msurname] and your address as [Maddress], OX[dig1][dig2?] [dig3][let1][let2]
                      & {Mstate CONFIRMADDR
                         Mpostcode OX[dig1][dig2?] [dig3][let1][let2]}

/ The next keyword points out when an 'OX' string doesn't appear to be a valid postcode
K OX[term?]
 <[Mstate]==ASKPOST>: R That doesn't look like a valid Oxford postcode to me. Please could you give it again?

/Finally, some no-keyword responses to deal with anything that hasn't already been picked up
<[Mstate]==ASKNAME>: N Please just tell me your first name followed by your surname.
<[Mstate]==CONFIRMNAME>: N Is your name [Mfirstname] [Msurname] - just yes or no, please?
<[Mstate]==ASKADDR>: N Your full Oxford address, please.
<[Mstate]==ASKPOST>: N Please just tell me your Oxford postcode.
<[Mstate]==CONFIRMADDR>: N Is your address [Maddress], [Mpostcode] - just yes or no, please?
