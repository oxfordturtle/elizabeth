/ This Script is derived from the one accompanying a public domain Eliza program
/ (of unknown authorship) written in Turbo Pascal and dating from 1987.  That
/ program (here referred to as "Turbo Eliza") is currently available from the
/ Simon Laven website at http://www.simonlaven.com where it is described as
/ "A brilliant Borland version for you to use at your leisure.  The best Eliza
/ on here".  The original Script has been corrected of various inconsistencies
/ and then translated for the Elizabeth program, to provide more or less
/ identical behaviour, for comparison and as a starting point for experimentation.
/ To enable the different functions of the Script to be "played with" independently
/ and incorporated separately within your own Scripts, it has here been modularised,
/ with its various parts being stored in five "#INCLUDE" files (of which the last is
/ easily the longest).  The same Script is also available as a single file, named
/ "TurboAll.txt".
