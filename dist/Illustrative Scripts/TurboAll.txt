/ This Script is derived from the one accompanying a public domain Eliza program
/ (of unknown authorship) written in Turbo Pascal and dating from 1987.  That
/ program (here referred to as "Turbo Eliza") is currently available from the
/ Simon Laven website at http://www.simonlaven.com where it is described as
/ "A brilliant Borland version for you to use at your leisure. The best Eliza
/ on here".  The original Script has been corrected of various inconsistencies
/ and then translated for the Elizabeth program, to provide more or less
/ identical behaviour, for comparison and as a starting point for experimentation.
/ This file contains the entire Script, but a modular version is also available,
/ whose main file is named "TurboEliza.txt".  The modular version separates the
/ different functions of the Script into distinct "#INCLUDE" files, making it
/ easier to "play with" them independently.
