# Elizabeth

## An Educational Chatbot for Windows

_Elizabeth_ is an automated conversation and natural language processing program
designed to provide an enjoyable and easy way in to natural language processing,
but with sufficient power to enable it to handle complex grammatical
transformations and even resolution theorem-proving, as well as straightforward
pattern-match/substitution responses. _Elizabeth_ can be thought of as an
adaptation of Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA program, in which the various selection,
substitution, and phrase storage mechanisms have been enhanced and generalised
to increase both its flexibility and its potential adaptability. The system also
incorporates analysis tables to show exactly what processing has taken place,
thus providing a learning tool that can give insights into some of the
fundamental methods and issues of artificial intelligence within an entertaining
context.

_Elizabeth_ was created by [Peter Millican](http://www.millican.org). Further
